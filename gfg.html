    <p><b>HTML</b> stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>. It is the standard language used to create and structure
        content on
        the web. It tells the web browser how to display text, links, images, and other forms of multimedia on a
        webpage. HTML sets up the basic structure of a website, and then CSS and JavaScript add style and interactivity
        to make it look and function better.</p>
    <i>How Does HTML Work? - HTML documents are plain-text files saved with an <b>.html extension</b>. Browsers read
        these
        documents, interpret the markup (tags and attributes), and render the formatted content on your screen.</i>
