Pothole Detection System using Deep Learning 
To detect potholes on roads, a model is developed for accurate identification and reporting. 
  1. Developed a Pothole Detection System using Python and OpenCV to identify road potholes from 
  images or live video feeds. 
  2. Implemented image processing techniques such as edge detection and contour analysis to detect 
  pothole regions accurately. 
  3. Integrated machine learning (CNN) for enhanced accuracy in distinguishing potholes from other road 
  irregularities. </pre></h3>
